# TriviaGame
This a quick trivia game that consists of multiple choice questions about sports. You are allowed to play the game once and accumulate as many points as possible. Once the game is complete, you are able to see your score. Also, you will be able to play the game again. The game questions are random from various sport topics. You will enjoy the random questions.
